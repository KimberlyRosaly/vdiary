Taking snapshots of thoughts, feelings, and events can be an integral part of being human. Keeping track of moments through personal writings and recordkeeping helps us stay in touch with ourselves all along the paths we take. Looking back into the past can be a major tool to navigating through our lives into the future.

Merging into a digital life, away from pen and paper, having the perfect place to lay it all down is essential. This application is a manifestation of what I, personally, want to see and use in a diary application, bounded only by current code-knowlege limitations.

VDiary is my perfect fit of a journaling interface for looking into life.
